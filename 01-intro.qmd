# **Introduction and Purpose**

---

Welcome to the Web Scraping course, where we embark on a journey from the basics of web scraping to the development of a fully automated, interactive web application. This course is designed to provide you with a solid foundation in web scraping, combined with practical skills in Python programming, automation with GitHub Actions, and building dynamic web apps using Streamlit.

#### **Course Objectives:**

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. **Set Up a Python Environment:**  
   Learn how to create and manage a virtual environment using `venv`, ensuring that your web scraping projects are isolated and dependencies are handled efficiently. This step is crucial for maintaining clean, reproducible, and conflict-free projects.

2. **Scrape Websites Efficiently:**  
   Master the essential techniques for web scraping using Python libraries such as `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`. You’ll start by scraping simple websites, like `example.com`, and gradually move to more complex tasks, such as extracting structured data from tables on websites like the SARS exchange rates page.

3. **Inspect and Analyze Web Pages:**  
   Develop skills in inspecting web pages using tools like SelectorGadget, enabling you to identify the correct HTML elements and CSS selectors to target for scraping. Understanding the structure of a webpage is key to extracting the right data.

4. **Automate Web Scraping Tasks:**  
   Automate the scraping process by setting up a GitHub repository and creating a GitHub Action with a CRON job. This will allow you to schedule your scraper to run at specific intervals, ensuring your data remains current without manual intervention.

5. **Build an Interactive Web Application:**  
   Finally, you’ll use Streamlit to build a web application that leverages your scraped data. In this course, you'll create a currency conversion tool that updates in real-time with data scraped from the SARS website, demonstrating how scraping can be integrated into a practical, user-friendly tool.

#### **Course Structure:**

This course is divided into the following sections:

1. **Getting Started:**  
   - Set up your development environment with a virtual environment and install the necessary Python libraries (`requests`, `BeautifulSoup`).
   - Detailed instructions are provided for both Windows and MacOS users.

2. **Scraping `example.com`:**  
   - A step-by-step guide to scraping a simple webpage.
   - Introduction to using SelectorGadget for identifying HTML elements to scrape.

3. **Scraping a Table from the SARS Website:**  
   - Learn how to extract structured data from tables and save it locally.
   - Troubleshoot common issues in scraping table data.

4. **Automating Scraping with GitHub Actions:**  
   - Automate your scraper to run on a schedule using GitHub Actions and CRON jobs.
   - Monitor and manage the automated process effectively.

5. **Building a Streamlit App:**  
   - Develop an interactive Streamlit app for currency conversion, using the data you’ve scraped.
   - Focus on creating a user-friendly interface and ensuring app responsiveness.
